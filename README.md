# spatialcluster
Testing the SpatialClusterAnalysis class is carried out on the TestSpatialClusterAnalysis class.
1. Classification process of each Antigen Complex with CluSMOTE Bag DT
2. List the paired residues from the predicted epitope residues, with the weights being the closest distances between the atoms making up the paired residues
3. Create a subgraph from the list of residual pairs
4. check whether the subgraph that is formed meets the specified conditions or not.
